        - Yes, I can code the solution myself and send a pull request

      placeholder: |
        Paste the file content here, no need for triple backtick tags

        Ensure that your config has redacted (but NOT removed) potentially-sensitive properties, such as:
        - IPCPassword (recommended)
        - SteamOwnerID (optionally)
        - WebProxy (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyPassword (optionally, if exposing private details)
        - WebProxyUsername (optionally, if exposing private details)

        Redacting involves replacing sensitive details, for example with stars (***). You should refrain from removing config lines entirely, as their pure existence may be relevant and should be preserved.
