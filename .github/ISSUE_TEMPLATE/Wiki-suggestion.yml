        # Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley

        ## Verse 1
        We're no strangers to love
        You know the rules and so do I
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy

        ## Pre-Chorus
        I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
        Gotta make you understand

        ## Chorus
        Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down
        Never gonna run around and desert you
        Never gonna make you cry
        Never gonna say goodbye
        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
