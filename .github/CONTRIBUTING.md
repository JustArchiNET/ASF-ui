# Contributing to ASF-ui

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ASF-ui. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

ASF-ui and all of its contributors are obligated to uphold the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security

If you think you have found a security issue, please do not mention it in this repository.
Instead, please follow our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for ASF-ui. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before submitting a bug report

* Clear the cache of your browser.
* Check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of ASF](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases/latest).
* Check if your problem has already been [reported](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/issues). If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. Try to avoid posting whole page screenshots. Instead, you should take a snippet of just the important part or if this is not possible, link to the screenshot with a detailed description. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of ASF) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of ASF?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of ASF from [the releases page](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
